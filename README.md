## About

Conductor is a web-based Ticket Management System that allows users to create tickets via a simple web form. Tickets detail an issue a user is having and consist of a title, a description of the issue, and some metadata such as the date and time the ticket was created, and the author's ID. Once a ticket is submitted, it can then be viewed by an administrator who can respond to and resolve tickets.
